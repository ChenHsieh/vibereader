# vibereader

**vibereader** is a poetic AI prototype that imagines how fictional personas emotionally respond to world events. It fetches current headlines from The Guardian, lets users select one, generates a unique persona with internal traits and crises, and composes a short surreal poetic reaction to the news. Built with Streamlit and OpenAIâ€™s latest API, it offers an experimental interface between language models and narrative simulation.

It demonstrates:
- Headline harvesting from RSS feeds (e.g., The Guardian)
- Persona simulation based on mood, role, and fictional crisis...
- LLM-based poetic response generation
- Streamlit app to display results

The ultimate goal is to serve as a creative writing or narrative seed generator.
